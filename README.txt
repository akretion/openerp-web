2. LINUX INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the installation instructions for Debian based Linux distributions.
Tested on Debian Etch and Ubuntu Feisty. The procedure might work with other 
Linux or similar distributions. See the docs on how to install the specified 
Packages on your favourite distro.

Prerequisites:

   1. Python >= 2.4
   2. Tiny ERP Server >= 4.2.1
   3. TurboGears >= 1.0.3.2
   4. matplotlib >= 0.87
   5. Python Imaging Library (PIL) 

Tiny ERP Server:

    To install Tiny ERP Server, please follow the instructions provided in 
    the official Tiny ERP Installation guide.

TurboGears:

	$ wget http://www.turbogears.org/download/tgsetup.py
	$ python2.4 tgsetup.py 
	
or

    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
    $ python2.4 ez_setup.py
    $ easy_install-2.4 TurboGears==1.0.3.2

Matplotlib 0.87:

    $ apt-get install python-matplotlib

Python Imaging Library (PIL):

    $ apt-get install python-imaging

eTiny! (latest):

    $ easy_install-2.4 eTiny
    
or 
	
	$ easy_install-2.4 easy_install-2.4 \
	  http://tinyerp.com/download/development/win32/eTiny-1.0rc2-py2.4.egg

Configuration:

    Locate the `config/app.cfg` in the installed `eTiny! egg`, and make 
    appropriate changes, especially:

    [tinyerp]
    server = "localhost"
    port = 8070
    protocol = "socket"

	where:

    server is the Tiny ERP server host...
    port is the Tiny ERP server port...
    protocol is the protocol to be used (socket, http or https)

If everything is installed properly, start the eTiny! HTTP server running 
the `start-tinyerp.py` script from the command line. 

If everything is done well you might see some thing similar to:

	$ start-tinyerp.py

If you see message showing `cherrypy._cperror.NotReady: Port not free.` make
sure no other application is running on the specified port (8080 is default).
You can change port for eTiny! by changing appropriate config value in 
`prod.cfg`.

If everything is fine, open your favourite web browser and type 
http://localhost:8080, and your can see welcome page with login screen.

Don't forget to enable cookies !

Of course, Tiny ERP Server must be running at that time. You should create a
database from the DBAdmin interface by clicking on Manage button that you can
see besides the Database selection box. After creating a new database login
with the admin/admin or demo/demo to see the eTiny! in action...
