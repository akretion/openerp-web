1.  Why based on MPL?

    -   MPL is one of the fastest growing OS licenses and widely recognized 
        Open Source licence by all open Source community.

    -   MPL guarantees end-user freedoms - Under MPL, end-users are free to 
        share, deploy, and integrate derivative works of "OpenObject web client"
        throughout their organizations as well as within their IT outsourcing
        partners without any obligation to open source any value-added IP. And 
        of course, enterprises can deploy the "Open Object web client" for an 
        unlimited number of users with no requirement to have a commercial 
        relationship with "OpenObject web client" editors.

        or closed-source extensions to the "OpenObject web client".

    -   MPL best ensures that value-added resellers do the right thing - Any

2.  Why add branding restrictions on MPL?

    These restrictions are only to maintain our trademark and branding. It will
    not affect in any case product copying, improvements, deploying, etc.

    We believe that community will not be affected by these few restrictions
    that's goal is only to recognise editors efforts. Source still opens and
    free so enjoy
